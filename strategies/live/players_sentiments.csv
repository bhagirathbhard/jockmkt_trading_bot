RF: Aaron Judge: Refuses to play after Mr Burns insists on Judge buying the Power Plant in exchange for playing. Mike Scioscia - was a veteran towards the end of his career entirely with one team, never any super flashy stats but thought of as a big clubhouse guy. Let's say **Salvador Perez**.

Don Mattingly - about 10 years into his career, had a dominant run but was coming off a couple down seasons, partially due to injuries. Nobody fits this exactly, but I could see any of Anthony Rizzo, Jose Abreu, or **Joey Votto**.

Steve Sax - One of the lesser known players, very promising peak but faced inconsistency both offensively and defensively. Let's say **Gleyber Torres** for this one.

Wade Boggs - Also had played about 10 seasons, was coming off a huge run but was widely underrated and never won any major awards. **Jose Ramirez** maybe?

Ozzie Smith - The longest-tenured player on the team, was still playing at a very consistent level and stuck at shortstop despite his age, also was essentially the centerpiece of his team. I'm thinking **Brandon Crawford**.

Jose Canseco - Relatively young left fielder, huge raw talent but was, arguably undeservedly, seen as somewhat inconsistent. **Juan Soto**?

Ken Griffey Jr. - Electric center fielder, only ~22 at the time of the episode's release, seen as one of the next greats, revitalized a rather inconsistent Seattle team. **Julio Rodriguez**.

Darryl Strawberry - One of the biggest stars in baseball at the time, huge power hitter, coming off a huge free agent deal. **Aaron Judge**.

Roger Clemens - 8 seasons into his career at the time, already seen as uniquely dominant and one of the best players in baseball. Again, nobody fits this super well, but **Shohei Ohtani** feels the closest.,Pete Alonso has never put up more than 5.0 fWAR. Aaron Judge has done that three times including an 11.5 fWAR season going into his walk year.,Of all the things that I thought would bring down a player with a massive frame like Aaron Judge, a toe injury that could take years to heal was not one of them,Aaron Judge being a toe away from A+ is killing me,Aaron Judge ""National League"" jersey...,""It was actually a complete tear of both ACLs""

Justin Verlander Cliff Lee, Clayton Kershaw, Roy Halladay, Max Scherzer, Justin Verlander,The insane person in me who wants the whole world to always know that Clayton Kershaw was and is the GOAT of his generation is annoyed that he keeps generating mid season injuries (‚Äúinjuries‚Äù?) that ultimately keep him from compiling more counting stats, and this year, maybe cost him a Cy Young.

The Dodger fan in me is stoked that he‚Äôs willing to sublimate personal glory for October success.

The 37 year old in me tips a glass to the man who takes a break. 

Cheers Clay, come back soon.,From June 27, 2015 to June 20th, 2016 Clayton Kershaw was 22-3 with a 1.38 ERA and 1.49 FIP in 247.2IP with 311 K‚Äôs and 24 walks. That is my favorite thing about him. 

Or y‚Äôknow Brandon Belt bring 4-67 with 30 strikeouts against Kershaw. I hope Clayton Kershaw can remain healthy enough to achieve his 3000th strikeout this year. 

I also  hope Clayton remains with the Dodgers until he retires. Clayton Kershaw is a Dodgers Legend!!!üòä My favorite Clayton Kershaw stat is that he led the NL in ERA in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.  Four consecutive seasons.

Only one other pitcher has done that and it was the great Sandy Koufax with 5 consecutive years.

Obviously the other one is his 2011 season.  Led NL in ERA, Wins, Ks for the triple crown.,A shame his career WHIP likely won‚Äôt creep back under 1.000 though. He was below that mark earlier this year, and having that with 2,600 innings under his belt and a sub-2.50 career ERA is just‚Ä¶ I love Clayton Kershaw."

Jesus Fucking Christ,After watching Ohtani‚Äôs leadership shine during the WBC (loved his kickass speech right before the WBC final), I have a feeling Ohtani will show his leadership again and is going to try his absolute best to will this team to the playoffs.


Hopefully he keeps his composure and remain consistent at the plate and on the mound (and not try to do ‚Äútoo much‚Äù), but if there‚Äôs 1 fucking person in the world that can lead a heavily beaten up team to glory, it‚Äôs Shohei Ohtani.,Red Sox ranker here, gonna do a long ass comment about my thoughts on the Sox as of midseason. 

We're at a bit of an inflection point, and based on the next 2-3 weeks of baseball we could be selling off any and all impending FAs, or we could end up trading for a starter and going for a wildcard run. At the moment, the Sox are 3.5 games back on Houston and the Yankees, both teams who are dealing with issues surrounding an aging/expensive core to some degree. 

With this in mind, it's not *insane* to imagine a playoff push if you're in FO brain mode and are assuming that none of your often injured players will be injured again. Like, yeah, if we got Sale, Story, Houck and a few other relief/bench players off the IL (and specifically Story back to SS to fill the gigantic roster hole we have there) by mid-August, the team would be looking good. *However*, when Sale's injury develops into boneitis or some shit, and Story's rehab pushing him to get back out there slows his return to the field, and Whitlock hits the IL for the rest of the season on some elbow strain shit, it's a lot harder.

However, in the short-term, things are looking pretty good for Boston. We play Texas first, and while I don't want to underestimate a very talented roster, they *have* been pretty mediocre since June (15-14, but with a 148-123 run diff). I'm assuming we take 1/3, but I don't think 2/3 is out of the question. After that, we get 3 games vs OAK, 3 @ CHC, 3 @ OAK, and 3 vs NYM. It's tough to get a run of 12 games that easy, and we get them leading right up to the trade deadline.

If we go on a tear and decide to not sell, I doubt we end up going very far. There is a perfect storm scenario where the injuries stop coming and we make a good deal at the deadline and wow gee whiz all of our rookies just kept getting better! I'd love to watch that version of the 2023 Red Sox, but I just don't have faith in the health of the rotation or even the cohesion on defense to say we have a championship squad here.

IANAGM, but if it was me in charge, I'm putting Paxton on the block as quickly as humanly possible. Dude is a ticking timebomb injury-wise, and every start we throw him out there for is just an unnecessary roll of the dice. He's a talented pitcher, but relying on him to make it to the playoffs healthy is just too risky. He has a lot of value for a team that has a solid rotation that is looking to boot their #5 starter into a long relief role. Even if he ends up injured, they still have the depth to fill in, and if he remains healthy, he's a strong #2 that you can get 6-7 innings out of.

After Paxton, there's a big list of guys in no particular order that I'd trade given that you can get anything in return. We have like 5 different middle infielders who are all hovering around replacement level, but only one of them costs 10 mil, so that alone is worth trading Hernandez, even if just to dump cash. Duvall just doesn't really fit on a roster where Duran is hitting the way he is currently (although I have my doubts long-term). Justin Turner is a very reliable DH, and trading would both save a chunk of 2024 money and net some sort of prospect return.

If you're going *full teardown* mode to clear as much money as possible for 2024, then get rid of Kenley and Kluber ASAP as well. Sure, you'll need to retain a lot of salary for Kluber in particular, but any amount of money you can free up here is key.

After all of this, here's what 2024 looks like. 

C - Wong/McGuire

1B - Casas

2B - Arroyo

SS - Story

3B - Devers

LF - Yoshida

CF - Duran

RF - Verdugo

DH - ???

Backups - Enmanuel Valdez, David Hamilton, Ceddanne Rafaela

Starters: Bello, Sale, Whitlock, Houck, Kutter/Pivetta/????

Relief: 8 local dunkin employees recruited on minimum contracts and Coldplay Guy

We definitely need help at 2nd, as well as a DH type (or if you're getting real wacky, send Casas to DH full time and sign a 1st baseman who can field). The rotation really need stability and durability over anything. Between Whitlock, Houck and Pivetta, there is oodles of long-relief talent, so getting a starter who can pitch deep into games will allow them to throw fewer but better innings. But, with the injury history surrounding Sale and Whitlock, adding another frontline starter on top of that would certainly quiet any rotation concerns.

If you go all in on the teardown, we're looking at ~120 million committed to the roster as is. That leaves an easy 80 million+ to go nuts in free agency, after already coming in well under the luxury tax in 2023 (pending my trades going through ofc). And that of course is when YOU SIGN MOTHER FUCKING SHOHEI OHTANI 10 YEARS 600 MILLION AHAHAHAHAHA THAT'S RIGHT BABY, IT WAS ALL OHTANI ALL THE TIME. SP/DH FILLS EVERY HOLE IN THE ROSTER, SHOHEI HITS 63 DINGERS AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS OVER THE MONSTER ONTO LANSDOWNE. BABE RUTH ROLLS IN GRAVE AS YANKEES BEGIN THEIR OWN 86 YEAR DROUGHT, SEE YOU IN 2095 FUCKERS!!!!!!,So Ohtani is Willie Mays, Babe Ruth, Max Scherzer, and Aaron Judge?  So Shohei Ohtani is basically Perfect Cell, but nice.  Who‚Äôs the best player in the LLWS this year?  That‚Äôs how we defeat Ohtani. but how many have had 35+ home runs? or 34 home runs and 1 triple? or...

edit: decided to do the research myself, using Ohtani as a baseline. 31+ home runs and 36+ hrs/triples before the all-star break has been accomplished... 12 times, most recently by this guy named Shohei Ohtani in 2021, when he had 33 hrs and 4 triples. completely unsurprisingly, Barry Bonds holds the record at 39 home runs (and no triples) before the all star break in 2001,Mike Trout ü§ù Shohei Ohtani.

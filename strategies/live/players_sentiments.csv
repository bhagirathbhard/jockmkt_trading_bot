Back in June Rashford gave an interview and one of the things he was talking about how ETH teaches and demands from him to be 100% focused on scoring goals and under no circumstances to drop deeper out of frustration of not getting ball for 20 minutes. 

He was talking how ETH wants him to stay focused during painful stages of play to be ready whenever ball happens to be near him to score goal. **Article Text**

Erik ten Hag has backed Marcus Rashford to hit another 30 goals next season so long as his “attitude is right”.

The England forward – who signed a new five-year contract this month – became the first United player since Robin van Persie 10 years earlier to score 30 in a campaign last term.

In February, Ten Hag warned Rashford that he must guard against “laziness” to remain one of Europe’s most potent forwards.

And he made a similar kind of plea in San Diego on United’s US tour by urging Rashford not to lose his focus.

“When his attitude is right then he will do that; it’s not easy and the team has to play well to put him in the right position,” Ten Hag said.

“When the team is playing well, so when we keep the rules and principles in our way of play and Rashford’s attitude is right and he puts himself in the right position, he will finish because has great abilities.

“When he is in the box, he’s clinical, he’s ruthless, and he scores goals, with his right foot, with left foot and with his head.”

## Players to step in Rahm’s footsteps

Some of United’s players will be heading to Torrey Pines, the world famous golf course in the La Jolla district of San Diego, on Friday when Ten Hag has granted them a day off. 

United have got three four-balls booked for that day, with the course – the scene of Jon Rahm’s 2021 US Open win – about a 20-minute walk from the team hotel. Defenders Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay and goalkeepers Tom Heaton and Nathan Bishop walked some of the course on Monday morning. 

McTominay – like Heaton and Maguire – is a keen golfer and took part in the Scottish Open Pro-Am event at the Renaissance Club in North Berwick the week before heading to the US for United’s pre-season tour.

## McElhenney to watch Wrexham match

Wrexham’s players are due to watch the San Diego Padres baseball team on Wednesday, the night after facing United in a friendly.

But Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson will not be joining his players at Petco Park to see the Padres take on the Pittsburgh Pirates. Parkinson will instead be out in San Diego with his wife to celebrate her birthday.

Ryan Reynolds, Wrexham’s co-owner and the Hollywood star of the Deadpool franchise, will not be at the SnapDragon to watch the League Two side take on a young United as he is currently filming in London.

But Rob McElhenney, his co-owner and fellow actor, will be at the match to cheer on Parkinson’s side.

## Ten Hag cuts promotional days

Ten Hag had the number of commercial days on United’s tour cut from three to two. The United manager understands the importance of the club promoting their brand, but not at the expense of the football and it is not uncommon to see the Dutchman putting a block on things he does not like in that regard.  It's amazing how Erik identified the most significant area for improvement in Rashford so quickly and pointed it out in such a succinct manner. 

Rashford has always been just one step away from becoming a truly lethal goal machine, and that step involves maintaining constant concentration from minute 1 to minute 90+5 and displaying an extreme thirst for goals. Concentration is a demanding trait, both mentally and physically, and it is often overlooked.,Love Gary’s incredibly basic maths questions to check if Rashford is actually good at maths.,Rashford to Vietnamese Premier League confirmed! HERE WE GOOOOOOOO,Tour Squad for Arsenal, Real Madrid and Dortmund

**Goalkeepers:** Nathan Bishop, Tom Heaton, Dean Henderson, Radek Vitek & Andre Onana

**Defenders:** Diogo Dalot, Alvaro Fernandez, Victor Lindelof, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Luke Shaw, Raphael Varane, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Brandon Williams.

**Midfielders:** Amad, Antony, Casemiro, Christian Eriksen, Bruno Fernandes, Dan Gore, Hannibal, Kobbie Mainoo, Scott McTominay, Mason Mount, Facundo Pellistri, Jadon Sancho, Donny van de Beek.

**Forwards:** Anthony Elanga, Omari Forson, Alejandro Garnacho, Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford.

***

A separate squad will travel and play vs Wrexham, and some players from the above squad are likely to join in.

That squad will include the likes of:

Kovar, J Evans, Fish, Jurado, Emeram, Hansen-Aarøen, Shoretire, Hugill, Collyer, Oyedele. 

Charlie Savage may not be included as he's allegedly near to a move to Reading.,Rashford is 25 and doesn't have the technical skill of Mbappe, nor positional skill and physicality of Haaland. 


There is no point comparing them, as they are miles apart. Rashford is probably never going to achieve Haaland ot Mbappe levels and there is nothing wrong with that. Even a step away from those two he can be a key component in a very dominant team. He is still relatively young, has been playing at the highest level with Man U for a while and has shown he can be a valuable goal contributor. If he gets a little more consistent and les streaky he will be remembered as a world class forward in his own right.,Marcus Rashford has signed a new contract that will extend his stay with Manchester United until 30 June 2028.
The Wythenshawe-born Academy graduate has made 359 appearances and scored 123 goals for the club since making his debut in 2016.

He capped off a fantastic 2022/23 season, in which he scored 30 goals, by winning the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year and Players’ Player of the Year awards.

Marcus Rashford said: “I joined Manchester United as a seven-year-old boy with a dream. That same passion, pride, and determination to succeed still drives me every time I have the honour of wearing the shirt.

“I’ve already had some amazing experiences at this incredible club, but there is still a lot more to achieve and I remain relentlessly determined to win more trophies in the years ahead.

“As a United fan all my life, I know the responsibility that comes with representing this badge and feel the highs and lows as much as anyone. I can assure you that I will give everything to help the team reach the level we are capable of, and I can feel the same determination around the dressing room. I couldn’t be more excited for the future under this manager.”

John Murtough, Manchester United Football Director, said: “Ever since he joined our Academy 18 years ago, Marcus has epitomised what it takes to succeed as a Manchester United player.

“He is a brilliant talent but also humble, dedicated and driven. As he enters his prime years, we know there is still so much more to come from him, and we can see the hunger that Marcus feels to achieve the highest levels of success here at Manchester United.

“Working with Erik ten Hag and his coaches is the perfect environment for Marcus to continue to develop into one of the best attacking players in the world.” Love Rashford and his story also the humbleness with his mum. So glad he is staying.,Onana, Evans and now Rashford.

What a day 😂 I wonder if we are going to see a one-club player in Rashford. They are pretty rare after all.,I think going back to one Rashford interviw can add little context.

What a day 😂 I wonder if we are going to see a one-club player in Rashford. They are pretty rare after all.,Get in Rashford!!! (still curious about the other English teams that offered him contracts) Rashford has been our second most consistent player after Bruno. 3/4 season of scoring and assisting 30+ goals and assists a season is a massive massive deal. How many players are doing that in the PL and how expensive would they be to sign? If we were to replace him it would cost us a minimum 100m in transfer and the incoming player would demand pretty close to what we are offering to rashford with no guarantee that the player would perform at the same level. 

£325k a week is a lot. But given his contribution to the club he definitely deserves to be among our top earners. Would be a different thing if we paid him £500k a week and broke the wage budget. But this is less than what Sancho, Casemiro and Varane make. Rashford has done more for us than all three of them combined.,1. Erling Haaland - £865,000-per-week (Daily Mail)
2. Kevin De Bruyne - £385,000
3. Mo Salah - £385,000
4. Casemiro - £375,000
5. Raheem Sterling  - £350,000
6. Romelu Lukaku  - £325,000
7. Marcus Rashford - £325,000

Football wages are stupid lol Honestly I don’t care about his salary, the bar was set with his previous contract. Under no circumstances could we have Rashford leave for free and he has earned his pay rise unlike other contracts we have handed out in the past. that's almost 85m in total over the 5 years, which if we lost Rashford as a free agent, wouldn't be near what an similar value player would cost to replace him

good business **Article**

>Marcus Rashford is set to sign a new five-year deal at Manchester United, having reached an initial agreement over fresh terms worth £325,000 per week.  
>  
>Negotiations are in the final stages, with the club’s top scorer of last season reaching an agreement in principle over a new contract that would keep him at Old Trafford until 2028.  
>  
>Rashford, whose present deal is worth about £250,000 per week, was rejuvenated under Erik ten Hag last season, scoring 30 goals in all competitions, and after interest from Europe the club have been keen to tie him down to a long-term deal.  
>  
>Talks have continued for some time and while he has had lucrative options from other clubs, with Paris Saint-Germain one of the teams interested in signing him, his preference was to stay at his boyhood club.  
>  
>The expected news of Rashford’s new deal is a boost to Ten Hag, who is looking to strengthen his forward line this summer. While a striker remains a top priority, United’s second signing could be confirmed in the coming days, with progress being made in talks with Inter Milan over the goalkeeper André Onana.  
>  
>It is understood that personal terms have been agreed on a five-year contract and the deal is in the final stages of being completed.  
>  
>With David de Gea leaving the club this summer, Ten Hag has needed to find a new No 1. The pair have a good working relationship after their time together at Ajax and the Dutchman was keen to have Onana with the squad for their pre-season tour.  
>  
>The travelling party fly to America on Wednesday night after their friendly against Lyon in Edinburgh.,Mount and Onana are done, and Rashford signing a new deal; glad to see us move forward for once PL AIN'T READY FOR PEAK RASHFORD🔥🔥 It’s crazy that Rashford is still just 25,!goalbot Rashford, Chelsea,Rashford and De Bruyne as perfect opposites,Reminds me of a Ronaldo physique - say what you want about the guy but he’s one of the best at maintaining his body. Looks like Rashford picked up a few things. Mbappe issue and Rashford still has not signing new contract makes me worried.

Hope rashford signs new contract soon,**[Ben Jacobs]** PSG must first resolve the Kylian Mbappe situation. That's the priority and their focus for now. Nasser Al-Khelaifi has said before he'd love to sign Rashford, but when PSG explored the deal last summer sources expressed frustration over talks.


A meeting was held with Rashford's camp and PSG came out of it feeling games were being played and their interest was being used as leverage.,I am more than happy to give Sancho another season but if he can’t hit double digits for goals and is still struggling to influence games I would sell him next summer. United need more players who can turn in 7/10 performances every single week, and that means we need more consistency from attacking players besides Bruno and Rashford.,**Article link**

## Manchester United continue talks over Atalanta's Rasmus Hojlund and Frankfurt's Randal Muani as they hope for breakthrough in striker search... while Marcus Rashford closes in on new contract

* **Man United are hoping for a breakthrough in their search for a new star striker**
* **Discussions are ongoing over moves for Rasmus Hojlund and Randal Kolo Muani**
* **United boss Erik ten Hag wants a new striker in place before pre-season begins**

>**Manchester United** are finalising details on Marcus Rashford's contract but hope for a breakthrough over a new striker.  
>  
>**Talks are continuing over their main targets Rasmus Hojlund of Atalanta and Randal Kolo Muani of Eintracht Frankfurt with Erik ten Hag eager to have a new striker in place for pre-season training.**  
>  
>United's budget will not stretch to a top striker and a goalkeeper so soundings have been made over cheaper alternatives to Inter Milan's keeper Andre Onana with **Justin Bijlow of Feyenoord and Kevin Trapp of Frankfurt in the mix but talks have still to advance.**

>A takeover would give United the chance to sign a striker then return to Onana later in the window while they also hope to raise funds with sales such as Fred who is on **Fulham**'s list of options.

>Ethan Laird has joined Birmingham City for £750,000 while a decision will be taken soon on Mason Greenwood, although a mooted move to Roma is considered unlikely.  
>  
>Hojlund is admired by United after a strong breakthrough season at Atalanta in Serie A where his season exploits gained him a reputation as one of Europe's brightest attacking prospects.  
>  
>The Denmark talent scored nine league goals in 32 appearances as Atalanta finished fifth in the Italian top-flight and qualified for next season's Europa League competition.  
>  
>At just 20-years-old, Hojlund is a player for the future and would hand United a promising solution to their goalscoring problems, although Muani is another alternative fit.  
>  
>The Frankfurt striker enjoyed a strong season for the Bundesliga club, bagging 23 goals and registering 17 assists in all competitions.  
>  
>A strong spell at the end of last year saw him score six goals in six German top-flight matches, while also impressing in the Champions League. ,Great player but still would prefer Diaby. If we can get Rashford for cheap (ie.<30m) or on a free could be worth it Isn't Rashford a LW?

The only reason he plays CF is because Man U doesn't have a CF... I don’t think there’s a chance in hell Rashford would join Paris. The only scenario I can see where he would even consider an offer would be if A: there was 100% clarity around Mbappe’s situation, and B: if Paris offered an insane salary.,Leao is only a year younger then rashford?"

I don't think mendy is a good person overall, but I will judge him as innocent over these 8 cases.

>Jurors in the rape trial of Manchester City footballer Benjamin Mendy have been told to question the credibility of their accusers.  
Lisa Wilding KC, in her closing defence speech on behalf of Mendy’s friend and co-accused, Louis Saha Matturie, highlighted the evidence of one complainant, a 19-year-old woman, who told jurors from the witness box that both men had raped her.  
But during the 16-week trial, mobile phone video emerged of her having “enthusiastic” sex with Matturie on an occasion she claimed she was being raped.  
Jurors at Chester crown court were directed to find both men not guilty of those charges against her.  
Wilding said: “She sat in this courtroom and looked you in the eye and gave what would have, perhaps, been a compelling and convincing account of being raped multiple times by these two men. Like so many of the witnesses in this case, she is caught up in a tangled web of connections and contacts and knowledge.  
“Why is that important? Because of collusion. You have to consider in respect of each of the women who came to this courtroom to give evidence, is their evidence reliable? Is their evidence solid?  
“This case rests on the credibility of witnesses. People lie.”  
Two other complainants, who also knew each other, then made “remarkably similar” allegations that Matturie had raped them both while sleeping, Wilding said.  
Wilding cited the account of another woman, aged 23, who claimed Matturie raped her at 5.30am in Mendy’s Mercedes car while on a trip to a local garage to buy more alcohol for a party at the footballer’s house.  
She stayed at Mendy’s house afterwards and had sex with three other men, and as she stepped out of the gates at Mendy’s mansion at 10.03am, sent a text to a friend saying “Hahaha I have slept with Jack Grealish,” the jury heard.  
Such behaviour was “inconsistent” with an allegation of rape, Wilding said.  
Her case was “inextricably linked” to that of a 17-year-old who alleges she was raped twice by both Mendy and Matturie the same night, it is alleged.  
Wilding said the allegation against Matturie, that he raped her in a cinema room at Mendy’s house while others were present, then went to his flat in Manchester where he raped her a second time, made “absolutely no sense”.

Manchester United’s players are waiting for Erik ten Hag to determine the make-up of the leadership group for the new season.

Ten Hag has appointed Bruno Fernandes as his new captain after taking the armband off Harry Maguire in one significant change.

Casemiro, the Brazil midfielder, was given the captaincy after Fernandes went off at half-time in United’s 2-0 win over Arsenal at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Saturday night.

It remains to be seen if Maguire – whose future at Old Trafford remains uncertain – forms part of the group next season.

At Manchester City, Pep Guardiola lets the players vote on who is in the squad’s leadership group.

But popular reserve goalkeeper Tom Heaton – who was part of the dressing room’s leadership team last season – says Ten Hag makes that decision at United and expects him to organise things before too long.

Asked if the group had been put together for the forthcoming season, Heaton said: “No not yet, it’s still quite early. There has been a change of captaincy as well but I’m sure it will get sorted at some point.

“This club sets the highest possible standards and you look to the leadership group to set those standards really. I was part of that last season and I would hope to be going forward as well. The manager put it together really. He organises that.

“We have got plenty of leaders in our dressing room and \[we\] get together if things need addressing or sorting or talking to the manager.”

## Ten Hag delighted by United’s aggression

Ten Hag – who has talked about his side “raising the bar” next season – was delighted with United’s performance against Arsenal and in particular the robust, aggressive nature of his team’s play and the hunger they showed even in a pre-season friendly. 

United’s uncompromising approach was reflected in Lisandro Martinez’s crunching challenge on Buyako Saka and Ten Hag is hoping to see more of the same from his senior players against Real Madrid in Houston on Wednesday. 

United trained in New Jersey on Sunday morning before heading to San Diego for the second leg of their US tour, with an academy side due to take on Wrexham at the SnapDragon Stadium on Tuesday. 

Anthony Martial is due to start training gradually with the first team this week as he steps up his recovery from the hamstring injury he suffered at the end of last season.

## Heaton to hold future talks

Heaton says he will sit down for talks with Ten Hag over his future amid interest from Luton Town and Everton in the veteran goalkeeper.

United have signed Andre Onana as David De Gea’s replacement but the club could yet bring in another back-up goalkeeper.

Dean Henderson is expected to be sold, most probably to Nottingham Forest, but it is still unclear if Heaton will stay or be allowed to move.

“Unsure at the minute. I’ve got to wait until I speak to the manager, sit down and see where we’re at,” Heaton, 37, said when asked about his future.

“I love it here. I have been part of this football club for a long time, but I also love playing, I can’t lie, so I will have a sit down and chat and see where we go.”

Heaton played in Saturday’s victory over Arsenal and admits he is keen to play more regularly as he nears the end of his career.

“At the moment it’s about getting fit, up to speed, taking the opportunity when it comes,” he said.

“I love playing, I love performing so when you get that opportunity in a United shirt you try to take it. That was the case against Arsenal.

“The two games I played last season. I really enjoyed it and it adds to the appetite. I’m still hungry to play. There’s still that drive to play.

“It’s that feeling, that energy in your body that you miss and I do miss it if I’m honest. But we will see how it plays out. Everything in life is a balance.”

## Fans’ San Diego yacht trip

United fans are set to enjoy an exclusive yacht trip around the impressive San Diego harbour on Tuesday morning local time in one of the latest supporters’ club events on the US tour. 

Unsurprisingly, tickets for the event sold out quickly. It follows a series of activities on the New Jersey/New York leg of the tour which included the club creating a pop-up United museum at the Marquis Marriott hotel in the heart of New York.

The museum featured exhibits including a shirt worn by ‘Busby Babe’ Duncan Edwards, and was visited by hundreds of fans.

## Evans could stay on

Paul McShane and Tom Huddlestone have both held player-coach roles in recent seasons that involved them playing for United’s under-21 team as well as doing some coaching. 

Huddlestone took over from McShane last summer and will continue that role this season. 

United are always on the look out for the right experienced veteran players to assist the club’s young talents and there are plenty at Old Trafford who would like to see Jonny Evans in the position. 

Evans, 35, still has his sights on playing at the top level, though, with Burnley thought to be one of the clubs interested in the Northern Ireland international. 

But it is not unfeasible that United could look to keep Evans beyond the summer if Harry Maguire was to leave and Ten Hag needed experienced cover at centre-half. Evans is expected to play against Wrexham. Bruno, Varane, Case, Licha & Shaw would a great brain trust lol.

Direct quote,Varane to #4 feels obvious but do we think he’s definitely going to change his shirt number? feel he would’ve already done so if he wanted it after Jones officially left the club

like when Bruno immediately took the #8 at the very start of last preseason after Mata had left,Bruno really NEVER stops kicking ball. Geez Bruno. Get some rest already. The dude is on vacation and spends it in training.,Nobody pulls people down to earth, or builds them up when they need it, in our squad like Bruno. Captain shit. What a leader. Bruno is just fantastic. If you have any doubt about that, see how much hate he gets on other PL teams' subs.,I can only imagine the windup Bruno would be on to Rice about moving teams Late Agent Bruno gazump here we go Bruno’s probably a right shithouse in that WhatsApp group “He got me,” Bruno said of Rice's slide tackle on him. ""That f***ing Declan boomed me."" Bruno added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times. He then said he wanted to add Rice to the list of players he works out with this summer in Portugal.,Winning the league or ucl with bruno as our captain is a dream i am willing to buy The rest of the PL is not ready for 20 goal Bruno this season. Without Bruno the team would have been hard to watch the last couple of years. Forever underrated, he is the best creative midfielder in the league. Gets sooooo much hate from outside our fan base - basically become the beacon , the player that every single ABU thinks epitomises their absolute hatred of United. 
Because of the absolute gravitas of that hate, it has somehow latched itself internally to some of our own fan base, become a victim of the repetitive complain injury, when people parrot the fuck out of something - in his case that he’s a moaning so and so and that he rolls around making mountains out of mole holes etc etc 


Yes - he can moan a bit here and there, but fuck me if there isn’t one legendary pashun player who never did that. 

Bruno is incredibly underrated, he’s Ballon D’or quality for sure. On a bad day he’s putting out a 7/8 out of 10. Every single game he will out that ball on a plate for one of the forwards. He’s an absolute genius and I’ve never seen anyone with such an engine. Most deserving of the captain band since Keane. I’ve supported United since I was 5 in 1990 and I’ve never really gushed for anyone too much - supporting the whole team and loved everyone (obvs some faves hear and there) but Bruno has been the most unreal transfer for a long long time. 

I hope so much that we get a forward who can finish - once we get the forward Ten Hag wants I really think that Mount will unlock Sancho and Bruno and we will play some devastating, sickening and filthy link up goals that drip with sex.,I am more than happy to give Sancho another season but if he can’t hit double digits for goals and is still struggling to influence games I would sell him next summer. United need more players who can turn in 7/10 performances every single week, and that means we need more consistency from attacking players besides Bruno and Rashford. I mean I appreciate the effort but at the end of the day if Sancho needs overlapping full backs to succeed, he’s not going to succeed with ETH. ETH’s whole system revolves around using underlapping full backs to create an overload in the midfield, he needs his wingers to stay wide to create the width, and to have the work rate to press and defend. That’s why he loves Antony. Having a modern GK is not gonna magically make the FB overlap just because they have to be wider. The second we have possession, one of them will under lap, and the other one go in a back 3.

But ultimately the terrible work rate is why Sancho won’t work out for us. We need our midfielders and wingers to press like crazy. Antony and Bruno are prime examples. And I think ETH being so adamant in bringing in Mount is another proof of that. Sancho stops pressing 20 mins into the game, and barely ever goes into 50/50.,I love how Bruno speaks his mind. And let’s be honest he is spitting facts. Bruno is Glazers out  Bruno. Always loved him, but he definitely won me over that time he defended Ole. The guy has character and fire in his belly, worthy to be called Manchester United's captain. Bruno gets it. As always,Nice individual goal for Bruno, but again that goalkeeper was at fault. Terrible match from him.,Bruno <3,I have a few and probably pretty obvious ones.

Shaw - Needs to keep his mind sharp, it very often happens that he loses the man on his wing because he's just not aware. Does cost us dangerously at times. This has been the case for a few seasons now.

Varane - Needs to get his headers on target. Need some long set piece goals and he's one of the ones that is tall enough to get to the ball before others.

Dalot - Needs to be more intelligent in his inverted role re his passing and vision to pick out a player.

Casemiro - Those loose passes oh my god, needs to cut those out himself before the opposition does.

Bruno - Just need his old finishing back T_T Also become my second dad if possible, ty.

Rashy - Seeking out of better options before getting into the box with the ball. He has the ability to carry the ball but those moments where he doesn't know what to do with it are wasteful. He needs to assess the situation better before he fully commits to the dribble.

Antony - He clearly has it, I want to see him build on how he grew into the last season. I mean build on everything, the passing, the pace, the trickery. Make it have some purpose. Cut out the overly stalling tricks and most importantly, get the finishing aspect together. The pace is there, exploit it properly without having any unnecessary step over turns.

Sancho - I have positive hopes from this one. He came back into action quite well after his mental health treatment. Considering he had no time with the team to gel and grow into the season, he stitched it up pretty nicely. I'm counting on him to improve on that. He needs to strengthen up slightly and be confident in himself. To not second guess himself would be a great start.

And then the team as a whole, learn the dark arts of tactical fouls for the love of god. City has mastered that around 4 seasons ago and none of the United players have a clue about it it seems. Casemiro needs to take them on a dark arts tour and teach them the essentials of when and how to make those fouls. I really need Bruno to play more minutes and care more on the pitch,Bully Bruno is back I don’t want to imagine a timeline where we didn’t sign Bruno. Love it. Can't wait for the Mount's first goal so Bruno can playfully kick him in the ass in celebration Bruno truly is Mata's disciple 😭😭 what a guy The Bruno pull, second to only Ten Hag heh Lol fucking love Bruno Fuck me brunos insta is legitimately one of the best things on social media, always lurking in the comments ready to strike 😂 “Welcome, but don’t think you’ll ever fucking rotate with me!

translating with deepl with minor edits for better understanding

> Palmeiras attacking midfielder Bruno Tabata was punished by the Disciplinary Court of Conmebol on friday and suspended for four months because of alleged racist acts committed in the match against Cerro Porteño from Paraguay, in a Libertadores match. Palmeiras however sees an error in the analysis of the case, defends the athlete as a victim and will appeal the decision.

> **Tabata and other athletes drew attention to report the racist acts committed by fans of the paraguayan team in the game played on May 24, and therefore the club believes that Tabata and the other players are victims.** Palmeiras then gathered videos and filed a complaint with the entity.

> In a completely backwards way, I was denounced by Cerro Porteño for the practice of racist gestures to the fans of the Paraguayan club in our Libertadores match away from home, acts that I did not commit in any way - said Tabata, in an excerpt from the video of the defense sent to the Palmeiras Conmebol.

> **In a video posted on social networks at the time, a fan recorded Palmeiras players while calling them ""monos"" (monkeys in Spanish).** During the broadcast of the match, it was possible to see the moment when the Verdão reserves show indignation on the side of the pitch.

> What actually happened was that I heard the fans shouting ""mono"" and ""monkey"" at us players who were on the field near the north stand. We don't speak Spanish and we didn't understand what was happening. So much so that Endrick walks up to me and asks what they were shouting. When we understood, I returned the question to them and wanted to understand if they were calling us monkeys. I was exposing the racism that was happening on the part of their fans, because they are the ones responsible, not us - said the player.

> **I think it is important to comment that Cerro Porteño claims that I am white and therefore it would be possible to say that I was racist with their fans.** In the first place this relationship of cause and consequence does not exist. Second, I felt disrespected by this argument since I don't consider myself white, but a brown man. It is not up to the club to identify my race in an accusatory way.

> The Palmeiras board will appeal the punishment, which is valid only for competitions organized by the South American entity. The club is convinced that the punishment will be reversed.

just when i thought conmebol couldn't be any more of a shitshow. punish the victims instead of the offenders. also, tabata is VERY CLEARLY not white. a simple google search will show you that."

Did they not know what kind of person he was before they offered him his current deal? A year ago both Mbappe and NAK said it was not about the money. They spoke for hours about the project and only 5 minutes about the money. NAK went on to say that Madrid was offering him even more than PSG was, and he rejected the money because he believed in the PSG project. So now they're admitting Mbappe is all about the money?

We are so close to completing a full squad,https://store3.psg.fr/en/paris-saint-germain-kylian-mbappe/t-36200371+a-6735576413+z-99-3381033309,It's basically what ruined team chemistry and made the attacking boring. Mbappe didn't like having fewer touches and was vocal about it, specially after international brakes. 

Neymar and messi were giving me flashbacks of them at barça, at the beginning of the season at least. It definitely changed the tactics and we were definitely worse. There aren't many ways that you can fit neymar, messi, and mbappe in the same formation together so they started to overlap, neymar and messi dropped deeper because the link upfront was lost. Then injuries happened and without a striker and options upfront we were very predictable. The best thing about MNM when mbappe was playing upfront as a striker was the unpredictability of messi and Neymar. But that left mbappe on the sidelines and he didn't like it. Neymar basically devoured and used mbappe, and messi was being all kind of creative while mbappe was just a finisher, i dont remember seeing him doing his runs much at the beginning of the season. As i said later on it was back to the same thing if mbappe running from the left side to score, very predictable, very easily defended against, especially without a target man and no neymar All the comments here… spot on! All because Mbappe wanted all the glory lol… watch this video. Notice how layer it became just Mbappe scoring and also he started taking the penalties? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mvNlxI5F08 Teams went from having to defend the entire pitch to only defending the left side of PSG….
Mbappe was the only one that could play as #9 and occupy the box last year. Galtier had Neymar and Messi behind him and Mendes/Hakimi as wingbacks. 
Once he refused to do it, it allowed teams to play higher and only defend the left wing because that’s where him, and Neymar play.  
2023 Messi likes to come back into the middle so there was really no threat coming from the right side of the field. Mbappe was our goal machine and Neymar and messi were as well but with more assists

So there was this whole drama about Mbappe being selfish which is untrue (under poch he was our best creator, even much more than Di Maria, and the main feeders of all the tape in that made Icardi look good his first months with us before the fraud was unveil).,> Here is a brief summary of the past six months at Paris Saint-Germain.
A record 11th league title, but 10 defeats in 50 games overall. A row between Neymar, Marquinhos and sporting director Luis Campos in the dressing room. A Champions League last-16 exit which exposed their lack of squad depth. A two-week suspension for Lionel Messi after skipping training for an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia. A protest by ultras outside the club headquarters, then another outside Neymar’s house. An absent Neymar pictured on social media playing poker in Monaco while his team-mates secured the title. A goalkeeper, Sergio Rico, seriously injured (but thankfully now out of ICU) when he was trampled by a horse. Messi missing the Ligue 1 player of the year awards to go to a Coldplay gig in Barcelona. A letter from Kylian Mbappe stating he does not want to trigger a contract extension. A head coach, Christophe Galtier, newly sacked while facing allegations of discrimination at a previous club — which he denies — with a trial looming and a possible three-year prison term if found guilty. mbappe singlehandedly sabotaging the sportswashing attempts from within, simply the goat How is it a Kylian Mbappe problem if Neymar, Messi, Marquinhos and Ocampos all did messed up things and the only thing Mbappe did was not renew?,Probably a 4-3-3:

To start the season (considering Hernandez and Neymar need to recover): Donnarumma; Nuno Mendes, Skriniar, Marquinhos, Hakimi; Verratti, Ugarte, Vitinha/Ruiz/WZE/new midfielder (if we sign one); Mbappe/Simons (if he joins), Asensio/new ST, Lee/new RW

It'll be interesting to see our new players fight for their spots - it would highly depend on their performances during the pre-season. We're definitely still in the market for a new striker and RW. Not sure if we're signing a new midfielder - I think we're in the market for Gabri Veiga but I doubt his ability in possession. I think he would flop just like Soler and Wijnaldum because they are similar players.

When Neymar comes back, things would get interesting. If Mbappe leaves, Neymar could play on the wing. But if Mbappe stays, Neymar is gonna be playing as a striker or a free 8 in a 4-3-3, unless Enrique switches to a 4-2-3-1 (which I think might suit us better with a Verratti-Ugarte double pivot). It's still a bit early to look at our probable lineups and I think we'll see a lot more during our pre-season if Mbappé extends. 442

Kimpembe won’t be back for a while, Lucas Hernandez can play LB since Nuno gets hurt quite a bit.,Wb dude, thoughts on mbappe??,“I don't know what PSG are missing (to win the Champions League), it's not too much of a question for me,"" Mbappe said. ""We did what we could, period. You have to talk to the people who make the team, who organise the squad, who build this club. Me, I just try to do my job as well as possible.
""I scored about forty goals in club (41), ten in selection (13). I was best player, top scorer for the fifth year in a row in Ligue 1. In the Champions League, unfortunately, I got injured before the first leg and, on the return, we were powerless. But in the group stage it seems to me that I was the most decisive player.
""I could do better by my standards. But no magic either. Even the other players gave their all. Sometimes in football you face what is called a glass ceiling. That's why it's not too much of a question for me but more for above."" What PSG needs to win the UCL is heart. They've got none. And neither does mbappe. He's a goal merchant. He's arguably the best player in the world right now but he's got no heart. I can see it from the way he plays. Hopefully he'll get some when he goes to Madrid.,Mbappe is being out played and out charisma-ed by a weird Scandinavian robot man, embarrassing.,They think he's mbappe,Nice analysis. Curious to see how PSG lineup. They need to sort mbappe situation asap and cash in on him. Then we'll see how they replace him,**[Ben Jacobs]** PSG still surprised Mbappe formally wrote he wasn’t triggering the one-year option on his current contract when it wasn’t legally necessary. Club also shocked they learned about the letter first via the media.

PSG will do everything possible to avoid losing Mbappe on a free. That means him signing a new deal soon, or the club really aggressively putting him on the market, almost to the point of trying to force him out to ensure they get a fee.

Mbappe, of course, can just let his contract run down. That’s what makes the situation really tense currently. Mbappe has PSG by the balls. He either gets them to cough up his loyalty bonus now and then moves to another club with a fat sign on fee or he waits a year, gets the bonus and his astronomical salary, then walks for free into any club he wants with an even fatter sign on bonus.

PSG should honestly pay his bonus now and sell him for what little they can recoup instead of nothing next year. Also, this Nasser guy needs to go for putting the club in a half a billion dollar hole over one player. Could’ve rebuilt half the squad. I would like to know what leverage PSG has on Mbappe to force him to sign an extension. I don't think threatening to bench him all season is believable. It's an empty threat. They wouldn't bench their best player. That is cutting your nose to spite your face. Paying the wages of someone who gives nothing back and then letting him go for free is even dumber than just using him and then letting him go for free. I can't wait for this whole thing to be over. 

Let's not give Mbappe more power by allowing him to extend for a year. I think he got enough money from PSG. Sell him now and start building a team without him with Enrique's choices. This is a step in the right direction for PSG, but too little too late when you've had a policy of throwing money at the problem for years.

How exactly is the ""door open"" when he is still under contract for another year?

The best they can do is be bitter about things and let him rot on the bench. 

Would they want to do something like that with the ""best player in the world"" they're so desperate to avoid having him leave on a free transfer?

This is just bullshit and projecting. This statement, the idea of having Mbappe leaving without money ""unacceptable"", this all screams ""entitled arab prince"" business-savvy.

Edit: typos,When i saw this, he followed it with ""i think you got the answer you wanted"". Mbappe is definitely gone 😂 I can't believe some people actually have the gall to praise him when *he* agreed to Mbappe's terms knowing full well this could happen and the day is finally here to bite him in the ass.,I wonder if Messi/Neymar/Mbappe being on the same team has limited their abilities to win more, or if it's added to it because they're enhancing each other's games.,From Wikipedia (goals) and Transfermarkt (assists)

**Club career overall**

Kylian Mbappe: 243 goals & 114 assists in 332 games = 1.07 goal or assist per game

Vinicius Jr: 77 goals & 68 assists in 299 games = 0.48 goal or assist per game

Jamal Musiala: 33 goals & 23 assists in 135 games = 0.41 goal or assist per game

**Their best individual season**

Kylian Mbappe (2021-22 season): 39 goals & 26 assists in 46 games = 1.18 goal or assist per game

Erling Haaland (2022-23 season): 52 goals & 9 assists in 53 games = 1.15 goal or assist per game

Vinicius Jr (2022-23 season): 23 goals & 21 goals in 55 games = 0.8 goal or assist per game

Jamal Musiala (2022-23 season): 16 goals & 16 games in 47 games = 0.68 goal or assist per game

**Internationals**

Erling Haaland: 25 goals & 3 assists in 24 games = 1.17 goal or assist per game

Kylian Mbappe: 40 goals & 24 assists in 70 games = 0.91 goal or assist per game

Vinicius Jr: 3 goals & 3 assists in 23 games = 0.26 goal or assist per game

Jamal Musiala: 1 goal & 3 assists in 23 games = 0.17 goal or assist per game I love Vini but Mbappe and Haaland are on another level. 


The full quotes from this subject where Kluivert thinks Musiala will eventually be on same level as Haaland/Mbappe/Vinicius

>**Guillem Balagué:**

>Talking about players, do you think, having been in the Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi decade, which has been like 15 years, that the next decade is going to be Haaland, Mbappé, Vinicius? That those are the three players that will fight for the Ballon d'Or?

>**Patrick Kluivert:**

>Well, one of them, for sure, will have the Ballon d'Or. At the moment, those three players are really dictating European football, even in their national teams. They're there. They're amazing. So, yeah, those three players are going to be the pioneers of the next generation. But there will be another player joining them soon.

>**Guillem Balagué:**

>How about new talents in football? We've mentioned Pedri, Jude Bellingham, Kwaracchelia, you've mentioned Musiala, Bukayo Saka as well... Who are you looking forward to see? How about Justin Kluivert?

>**Patrick Kluivert:**

>Oh, my son is doing good. He was, unfortunately, injured a couple of weeks ago. But now, I think, when he plays, he makes his team play more vertical. He's quite agile, scoring goals. And, of course, you've got the new talents coming in. Bellingham, as I said, Bukayo Saka. 

>But for me, Musiala is one of the fantastic players. I really like this player and how he manages to come out of situations when things are getting difficult. He's a very good player to watch out for in the next season, because the next season, he will play for sure, like this year in the first 11, although he's quite young, but for me he is a fantastic player.,I feel like he has this somewhat relaxed approach to the game. His ability is so great its generally easy for him. I think because of this he lacks a certain aggression that holds him back. Neymar is similar. Halland on the other hand has great ability but also never stops trying and plays with aggression and with a much better fight. He has nowhere near the ability of mbappe but looks likely right now to achieve more.,Yeah Liverpool which was heavily linked with Bellingham couldn’t get 100M for him but they will find 300M for Mbappe 😂😂 As a Liverpool fan, we will not be buying Mbappe, we didn't have the budget to afford Bellingham, and his transfer fee and wages are significantly less than Mbappe.

Newcastle, Utd, City and maybe Chelsea are the only ones in England that could realistically buy him, and the only attractive team has a better striker already.,It’s hard to believe Madrid will pay that much. At the same time, it depends on mbappe’s demands. If Mbappe demands a 150m signing bonus, paid up front… then it makes sense for Madrid to pay 200 over a few years and also get him early.

There are too many variables."
